# Marcianitos p√©ndulo

This is a entry for the competition https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaq24krSKow

You get a video of pendulum moving as "input", and you can do with it whatever you desire.
So we decided to make a space shooter, because why not.

It's an excuse like any other to learn canvas and image processing inside the browser.
As a bonus, I took a trial of github copilot.

It was coded in no time, so don't take it seriously. A lot of shortcuts were taken.

Some notes:
* You still need the footage.mp4 as input, it felt ridiculous to upload it here.
* We have to look into animations and sound
* crossorigin sources are still a pain
* async loading is still ridiculous
* copilot is too smart
